# X-CHROM


## Introduction

X-CHROM is the model which estimates the X chromosome heritability 
and dosage compensation ratio from familial relationship and their phenotype. This model does not require genotype information.


## Usage

Check `./notebook/simualtion.ipynb` for the usage of X-CHROM.
This file contains the 
    1. familial phenotype simulation process,
    2. estimating the X chromosome heritability (X-CHROM).


## Miscellaneous

For a better understanding on the dosage compensation (DC), 
check the `./notebook/dcSimulation.ipynb`. In this notebook, we describe why the variance explained by the X chromosome is half in females in the full dosage compensation.
